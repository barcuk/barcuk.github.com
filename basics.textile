h3. Meetings

We meet once a week. This term, we're meeting on Wednesdays at 2pm in the robot lab. These meetings are to show progress on (and brag about) the robots during the past week.

h3. Mailing List

This is where most of the online communication happens. You can join by signing up at "https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/robot-club":https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/robot-club

h3. IRC

IRC is internet chat from the olden times. We work with computers a lot and we like to hold onto these relics from the past. We're on the @#barc@ channel on the @freenode@ network. If you need any help setting up IRC, just ask on the mailing list.
